# Testing_SciPy

I studied the very most important functions of SciPy. I have divided them into some jupyter notebooks with graphs and explained on spanish. 

For the 5ยบ and 6ยบ the data was downloaded from: https://github.com/javier-lorenzo/Aprendizaje-Automatico-I/tree/main/Practica%205

All these projects were made on DataSpell, a Jet brains app.
